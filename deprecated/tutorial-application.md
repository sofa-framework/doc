**NOTE:** Every scene detailed in tutorial can also be launched using the [runSofa](../../getting-started/run-sofa/) application directly.

Tutorial Application
--------------------

The source file of SOFA Tutorials is found in folder
`SOFA_DIR/examples/Tutorials` The Tutorial Application is embedded
inside the SOFA Modeler. To launch it, first launch Modeler, and then go
to the Tutorial Menu, or simply click on its icon. \[caption

The Tutorials \[/caption\] Initially, it is composed of two parts, from
left to right:

-   **A Tutorial Selector**: we can choose different categories of the
    Tutorials: Step by Step, Collision, ForceFields, Mappings, ... or
    the whole SOFA Tutorials "All SOFA Tutorials".
-   **A HTML based description**: a brief description of the
    corresponding category.

When a category (e.g Step by Step) is chosen and if we double-click on a
component of that category, the third part appears:

-   **A SOFA Scene-Graph**: the representation of SOFA components. You
    can modify/delete a component by right-clicking on that component.
