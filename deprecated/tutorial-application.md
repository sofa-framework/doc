Tutorial Application
--------------------

The source file of SOFA Tutorials is found in folder
`SOFA_DIR/examples/Tutorials` The Tutorial Application is embedded
inside the SOFA Modeler. To launch it, first launch Modeler, and then go
to the Tutorial Menu, or simply click on its icon. \[caption

The Tutorials \[/caption\] Initially, it is composed of two parts, from
left to right:

-   **A Tutorial Selector**: we can choose different categories of the
    Tutorials: Step by Step, Collision, ForceFields, Mappings, ... or
    the whole SOFA Tutorials "All Sofa Tutorials".
-   **A HTML based description**: a brief description of the
    corresponding category.

When a category (e.g Step by Step) is chosen and if we double click on a
component of that category, the third part appears:

-   **A SOFA Scene-Graph**: the representation of SOFA components. You
    can modify/delete a component by right clicking on that component.
    You can also add another component to the scene graph by clicking on
    "Edit in Modeler". In Modeler you can run the scene using SOFA (see
    [Modeler](https://www.sofa-framework.org/community/doc/modeler))
