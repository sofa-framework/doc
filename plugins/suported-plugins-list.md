# Officially supported plugins

This page aims at summarizing all plugins that are officially supported by the SOFA consortium.
This means that the SOFA consortium commits to:
1. Including them in our continuous integration pipeline, thus assessing the compilation at every push in the SOFA master branch, at each new pull-request and at each nightly build
2. Including them in the official bi-annual SOFA binaries 
3. Providing technical support on these plugins
