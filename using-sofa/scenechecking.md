# Scene Checking

When the `runSofa` application loads a scene, it performs several verification checks. These checks help ensure the scene follows implicit design rules. If any issues are detected during the verification process, warning messages are displayed in the console.

Using a SOFA built from sources, you can activate or de-activate these checks using the CMake flag `APPLICATION_SCENECHECKING`
