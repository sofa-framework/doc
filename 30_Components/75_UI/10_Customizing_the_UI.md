title: Customizing the UI
---

#### AttachBodyButtonSetting

Tune the attachBody mouse operation, like which button is used for the
operation and the stiffness of the spring.

#### FixPickedParticleButtonSetting

Specify the mouse button used for this particular operation.

#### ViewerSetting

Customize things like the resolution of the viewer, the camera
projection, and the picking method. The picking can be done through ray
casting (default) or can be imaged based by using a selection buffer. If
you use the picking with the selection buffer you can only pick the
surfacic primitives like triangles and spheres which belong to the
collision layer of your models.

#### BackgroundSetting

Tune the color or the image used for the background of the viewer.

#### SofaDefaultPathSetting

Tell Sofa where to put your simulation records and gnuplot files.

#### StatsSettings

Give access to various logging options.
