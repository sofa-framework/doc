Intersection Method
===================

In SOFA, a proximity method can be used to detect contact when two objects are getting closer from another.
Evalutating this proximity allows for a better anticipation of the contact, i.e. more stable contact.

Examples of Components
======================

The following components are all intersection methods, and can be placed in a simulation scene:
- [_MinProximityIntersection_](https://www.sofa-framework.org/community/doc/using-sofa/components/collisions/intersectiondetections/minproximityintersection)
- [_LocalMinDistance_](https://www.sofa-framework.org/community/doc/using-sofa/components/collisions/intersectiondetections/localmindistance)
