Intersection Method
===================

In SOFA, a proximity method can be used to detect contact when two objects are getting closer to another.
Evaluating this proximity allows for a better anticipation of the contact, i.e. more stable contact.

Examples of Components
======================

The following components are all intersection methods, and can be placed in a simulation scene:

- [_MinProximityIntersection_](./../minproximityintersection)
- [_LocalMinDistance_](./../localmindistance)
