title: How to compile a plugin
---

In order to develop your own codes, SOFA allows to develop plugins separately from the SOFA open-source core. This tutorial shows how to organize and compile one or several plugins outside from SOFA.

Linux (with SOFA sources)
-------------------------

This video shows how to download and compile a plugin ( [MyAwesomeComponents](https://github.com/sofa-framework/MyAwesomeComponents) ) when you have a compiled version of SOFA. The operating system is a fresh XUbuntu (18.04). The plugin sources are located out from the SOFA sources, but compiled with SOFA.
