# IdentityMapping

This component is classified under the category of Mappings.

In this particular mapping, we designate the input as the parent state and the output as the child state.
The transformation function employed in this mapping is the identity function.
Formally, if $f$ denotes the mapping function, then for any input $x$, the output $f(x)$ is exactly $x$.
In other words, the identity function directly maps each element to itself without any modification.

Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$ f(x)=x $

for all $x$ in the domain.

The Jacobian matrix of this mapping, which represents the first-order partial derivatives of the output with respect to the input, is the identity matrix.
This means that the rate of change of each output variable with respect to the corresponding input variable is 1, while the rate of change with respect to all other variables is 0.
The identity matrix $I$ in this context can be defined as:

$$
J=I
$$

where $J$ is the Jacobian matrix, and $I$ is the identity matrix.

Furthermore, the transpose of the Jacobian matrix, denoted as $J^T$, is also the identity matrix.

Given that the Jacobian matrix is constant and does not vary with the input, the second-order partial derivatives of the mapping are zero.
Hence, the Hessian matrix, which contains these second-order derivatives, is a null matrix (a matrix where all elements are zero).

## Implementation Details

Given the fact that the mapping function is the identity, the `apply` method effectively performs a direct copy of the input state into the output state.
Since the Jacobian matrix is the identity matrix, the `applyJ` method also operates as a simple copy.
Similarly, for the `applyJT` method, which applies the transpose of the Jacobian matrix, the operation remains a straightforward copy.

The Hessian matrix being null means that the second-order derivatives of the mapping function are zero.
Consequently, methods that depend on the Hessian matrix, such as `applyDJT` and `buildGeometricStiffnessMatrix`, will be effectively empty or trivial.
These methods do not need to perform any computations because there are no second-order effects to account for in the mapping.
