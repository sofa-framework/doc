MeshSTLLoader
=============

This component belongs to the category of the [MeshLoaders](../../../../simulation-principles/topology/#meshloaders).

The MeshSTLLoader loads a mesh from a file under the [format \*.stl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)). Such a mesh file **only supports surface meshes**. The \*.stl format is widely spread and such meshes can be generated using software like [MeshLab](https://www.meshlab.net/) or [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org) among many other solutions.
