TextureInterpolation
====================

This component belongs to the category of [Engines](../../simulation-principles/engine/). This engine creates texture coordinate in 1D according to an input state vector.  Coordinate can be interpolated either from min and max value of input states (default behavior) or on a manual define scale.
